'''
We have a list of two IPs in the code area.

Extend the code so your program:

1. Prompts the user to input an index (e.g., 0 or 1).

2. Depending on the user input, the program should return either You chose 100.122.133.111 or You chose 100.122.133.111

Note: In order for the system to mark your exercise as correct, 
your code should return the exact output
(i.e., upper case Y in You chose and no spaces or other characters after the IP.
